GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true

# Your Google Cloud Project ID
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id

# The location of your Google Cloud Project (e.g., us-central1)

# --- Authentication ---
# The Conductor expects Google Cloud credentials to be available in the environment.
# For local development, you can authenticate using the gcloud CLI:
# 1. gcloud auth application-default login
#
# For Docker, the recommended approach is to mount your gcloud configuration directory:
# In docker-compose.yml, under volumes, add:
# - ~/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud
#
# The GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS variable is typically not needed when using the above methods.
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=

# --- (Optional) Mongo State Provider ---
# MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/conductor_state
