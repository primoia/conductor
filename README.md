## üöÄ Overview

Conductor is a multi-agent framework designed to provide a robust platform for AI-assisted development and automation. It allows you to create, manage, and orchestrate specialized AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex coding tasks by interacting with your codebase.

```

-   **Orchestrate Complex Workflows:** Define multi-step plans in simple YAML files and let Conductor execute them automatically.
-   **Interact with Specialist Agents:** Dialogue with AI agents that have access to your code, enabling a conversational approach to development.
-   **Multi-Provider Support:** Flexibly switch between different AI providers like Gemini and Claude for each agent.
-   **Safe & Secure:** Agents operate in a secure environment with scoped file system access and human-in-the-loop confirmations for critical operations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   üí¨ **Interactive Sessions:** Engage in conversations with AI agents to refine ideas and co-create solutions.
-   ü§ñ **Multi-Provider AI:** Configure different AI models for different agents to leverage the best tool for the job.
-   üìÇ **Environment-Oriented Architecture:** Safely manage and operate on multiple projects and environments.
-   üõ†Ô∏è **Scoped Tool System:** Grant agents secure and controlled access to the file system.
-   üß¨ **Metaprogramming:** Use agents to create and manage other agents, enabling a self-improving system.
-   üìã **Plan-Based Execution:** Automate complex coding tasks by defining a sequence of steps in a YAML workflow.

### üí° A Practical Example

**The traditional way:** To add a field to a database entity, you need to:
1.  Write the database migration.
2.  Change the entity class in the code.
3.  Update the DTO (Data Transfer Object).
4.  Expose the new field in the API.
5.  Update the tests.

**With Conductor:** You simply instruct the agent:
> *"Add a 'last_login' date field to the User entity, including the database migration, DTO, and API endpoint."*

Conductor then orchestrates the specialist agents needed to execute all steps automatically.

### üë• Who is Conductor for?
- **Developers & Agile Teams** who want to accelerate development and automate repetitive coding tasks.
- **DevOps Engineers** looking to automate the configuration and maintenance of infrastructure as code.
- **AI Enthusiasts** who want a robust platform to build and experiment with multi-agent systems.

## Getting Started

O Conductor agora opera sob uma arquitetura unificada e orientada a servi√ßos. Toda a configura√ß√£o √© centralizada no arquivo `config.yaml` na raiz do projeto.

### 1. Configura√ß√£o

Antes de rodar qualquer agente, configure seu ambiente no `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# config.yaml
storage:
  type: filesystem
  path: .conductor_workspace

# Adicione aqui diret√≥rios para suas ferramentas customizadas
tool_plugins:
  - custom_tools/
```

-   **storage**: Define onde os dados dos agentes s√£o armazenados.
    -   `filesystem`: (Padr√£o) Ideal para desenvolvimento local, n√£o requer depend√™ncias.
    -   `mongodb`: Para ambientes de equipe ou produ√ß√£o.
-   **tool_plugins**: Lista de diret√≥rios onde o Conductor ir√° procurar por ferramentas customizadas.

### 2. Executando Agentes

Embora estejamos caminhando para um CLI unificado, voc√™ ainda pode usar os CLIs `admin.py` e `agent.py`. Eles agora operam como interfaces para o novo servi√ßo central e respeitam o `config.yaml`.

**Para Meta-Agentes:**
```bash
poetry run python src/cli/admin.py --agent AgentCreator_Agent --input "Crie um novo agente para analisar logs."
```

**Para Agentes de Projeto:**
```bash
poetry run python src/cli/agent.py --environment develop --project desafio-meli --agent ProductAnalyst_Agent --input "Analise os dados de produtos."
```
