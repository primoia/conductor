## üöÄ Overview

Conductor is a multi-agent framework designed to provide a robust platform for AI-assisted development and automation. It allows you to create, manage, and orchestrate specialized AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex coding tasks by interacting with your codebase.

```

-   **Orchestrate Complex Workflows:** Define multi-step plans in simple YAML files and let Conductor execute them automatically.
-   **Interact with Specialist Agents:** Dialogue with AI agents that have access to your code, enabling a conversational approach to development.
-   **Multi-Provider Support:** Flexibly switch between different AI providers like Gemini and Claude for each agent.
-   **Safe & Secure:** Agents operate in a secure environment with scoped file system access and human-in-the-loop confirmations for critical operations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   üí¨ **Interactive Sessions:** Engage in conversations with AI agents to refine ideas and co-create solutions.
-   ü§ñ **Multi-Provider AI:** Configure different AI models for different agents to leverage the best tool for the job.
-   üìÇ **Environment-Oriented Architecture:** Safely manage and operate on multiple projects and environments.
-   üõ†Ô∏è **Scoped Tool System:** Grant agents secure and controlled access to the file system.
-   üß¨ **Metaprogramming:** Use agents to create and manage other agents, enabling a self-improving system.
-   üìã **Plan-Based Execution:** Automate complex coding tasks by defining a sequence of steps in a YAML workflow.

### üí° A Practical Example

**The traditional way:** To add a field to a database entity, you need to:
1.  Write the database migration.
2.  Change the entity class in the code.
3.  Update the DTO (Data Transfer Object).
4.  Expose the new field in the API.
5.  Update the tests.

**With Conductor:** You simply instruct the agent:
> *"Add a 'last_login' date field to the User entity, including the database migration, DTO, and API endpoint."*

Conductor then orchestrates the specialist agents needed to execute all steps automatically.

### üë• Who is Conductor for?
- **Developers & Agile Teams** who want to accelerate development and automate repetitive coding tasks.
- **DevOps Engineers** looking to automate the configuration and maintenance of infrastructure as code.
- **AI Enthusiasts** who want a robust platform to build and experiment with multi-agent systems.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a fully functional Conductor environment running.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cezarfuhr/conductor.git
cd conductor
```

**2. Configure Your Environment**

Conductor requires API keys to connect to AI providers.

```bash
# Create your personal environment file from the template
cp .env.example .env
```
Now, open the `.env` file and add your API key(s) (e.g., `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

**3. Run with Docker (Recommended)**

This is the easiest way to start. With your `.env` file configured, simply run:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The service will be available, and you can start interacting with agents.

**4. (Alternative) Run with a Local Python Environment**

If you prefer a local setup:
```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run an agent
poetry run python src/cli/agent.py --agent MyAgent
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start: Running Your First Agent

Conductor uses a simple CLI to interact with agents. The main entry point is `src/cli/agent.py`.

1.  **Configure a Workspace:**
    First, tell Conductor where your projects are located by editing `config/workspaces.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    # config/workspaces.yaml
    workspaces:
      # Maps the 'default' environment to a specific directory
      default: /path/to/your/projects
    ```

2.  **Run an Agent:**
    Use the following command to start an interactive session with an agent.
    ```bash
    # Syntax: poetry run python src/cli/agent.py --environment <env> --project <proj> --agent <agent_id>
    
    # Example:
    poetry run python src/cli/agent.py --environment default --project my-cool-project --agent CodeGenerator_Agent
    ```
    This will start a chat session where you can give instructions to the `CodeGenerator_Agent` to work on `my-cool-project`.
