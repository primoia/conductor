## Best Practices for Using Hunter Agent

### 1. Be Specific with ICP
The more detailed your ICP criteria, the better the qualification and scoring.

### 2. Include Pain Points
When you specify pain points, the agent can better evaluate lead fit and suggest relevant messaging.

### 3. Define Disqualifiers
Explicitly state what makes a prospect NOT a good fit to save time.

### 4. Request Actionable Output
Ask for next steps, outreach strategies, or specific recommendations.

### 5. Iterate Based on Results
If initial results aren't matching expectations, refine your ICP based on the agent's findings.

---

## Output Customization

You can request specific output formats:

**For CRM Import**
"Export results as CSV with columns: Company Name, Website, Contact Name, Title, Email, Score"

**For Outreach Campaign**
"Group leads by industry and suggest personalized outreach angles for each segment"

**For Analysis**
"Provide summary statistics on: average company size, most common technologies, geographic distribution"

**For Prioritization**
"Rank leads by score and identify top 5 highest-priority prospects with detailed profiles"

---

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with wider criteria, then refine based on results
2. **Combine Criteria Wisely**: Use 3-5 key criteria rather than 10+ to avoid over-filtering
3. **Verify Critical Data**: Always review contact information and company details before outreach
4. **Use Geographic Specificity**: Specify cities/regions rather than just countries when possible
5. **Include Timing Signals**: Recent funding, hiring, or product launches indicate higher intent
6. **Test Search Queries**: Ask the agent to show its search strategy and refine if needed
