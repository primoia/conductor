# Plan-Based Execution

For automation and complex CI/CD tasks, the framework utilizes the **Conductor Orchestrator**, a non-interactive executor that follows an implementation plan.

**How it works:**
1.  **YAML Plan**: You define a sequence of tasks in a `.yaml` file.
2.  **Executor**: The Conductor Orchestrator reads this file.
3.  **Orchestration**: The Conductor invokes the necessary agents in the defined order, passing the outputs of one step as inputs to the next.

This enables the automation of task chains, such as: `Analyze Requirement` -> `Generate Code` -> `Create Tests` -> `Document`. This feature is crucial for automating repetitive development tasks, ensuring consistency, and accelerating the software delivery pipeline.
