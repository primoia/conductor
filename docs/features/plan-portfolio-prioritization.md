# The Plan Portfolio Prioritization Game

**Status:** In Design

## 1. Problem: The Extensive Backlog Dilemma

As the Conductor system is used, a large backlog of improvement, refactoring, and new feature plans will be generated. However, execution capacity, especially that which requires human supervision, is a limited resource. The challenge is: given a backlog of 100+ potential plans, how to select the 2 or 3 that should be executed in the next cycle to maximize value and impact on the project?

## 2. Proposal: Game Theory for Strategic Selection

We propose the application of Game Theory not at the task execution level, but at the **strategic planning** level. Instead of a simple queue (first-in, first-out) or manual prioritization, we create a "game" where plans compete with each other for the right to be included in the next execution portfolio.

The goal is not to select the best individual plans, but rather the **best and most synergistic portfolio of plans**.

## 3. The Game Mechanics

### 3.1. The Players

Each plan in the backlog is a "player," competing for one of the limited execution "slots" of the next cycle.

### 3.2. The Plan's "DNA"

To compete, each plan needs a metadata header with quantifiable attributes that define its strategic profile:

```yaml
# Example of metadata in a .md plan file
metadata:
  id: PLAN-075
  estimated_impact: 8      # (1-10) Business or technical value generated.
  estimated_risk: 4        # (1-10) Probability of failure or side effects.
  dependents: [PLAN-088, PLAN-092] # Other plans that depend on this one.
  blocked_by: [PLAN-042] # Plans that need to be completed before.
  resource_cost: 7        # (Points) Estimated time/API cost.
  age: 25                # (Days) Time in the backlog.
```

### 3.3. The Prioritizer Agent

A new system agent, the **"Prioritizer Agent"**, is responsible for running the game. It analyzes all the plans in the backlog and simulates different combinations (portfolios) to find the optimal one.

## 4. The Portfolio Payoff Function

The selection criterion is the **"Portfolio Payoff"**. The Prioritizer Agent does not evaluate a plan in isolation, but the value of the set of plans. The evaluation function can be:

`Portfolio_Payoff = (Σ Impacts) + (Synergy Bonus) - (Risk Penalty) + (Unlocking Bonus)`

*   **Σ Impacts:** The simple sum of the impact of each plan in the portfolio.
*   **Synergy Bonus:** The portfolio receives extra points if the plans complement each other. (Ex: One plan refactors a service and another adds a feature to that same service. Doing them together is more efficient).
*   **Risk Penalty:** The total risk of a portfolio can be greater than the sum of its parts if the plans alter the same critical files. This penalty models the integration risk.
*   **Unlocking Bonus:** The portfolio gains points based on how many other plans in the backlog it unlocks (by resolving their dependencies).

## 5. The New Architectural Flow

This game introduces a new layer at the top of the execution architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Backlog of 100+ Plans] --> B[Prioritizer Agent];
    B -- Runs the "Portfolio Game" --> C{Optimal Portfolio (N Plans)};
    C --> D[Human Operator / Execution Queue];
    D -- Approves and Initiates --> E[Multiple Maestro-Executor Flows in Parallel];
```

## 6. Conclusion

This model elevates Game Theory from a tactical tool to a **strategic governance tool**. It allows Conductor to make high-level decisions about "what to do next," ensuring that limited execution resources are always allocated to the set of tasks that promises the greatest strategic return for the project.
