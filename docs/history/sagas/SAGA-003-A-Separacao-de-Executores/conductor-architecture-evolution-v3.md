# Conductor Architecture Evolution v3.0
## Strategic Plan: Direct Resolution + Containerized Execution

**Document Type:** Strategic Technical Plan  
**Author:** Staff Engineering Team  
**Date:** 2025-08-17  
**Status:** Draft  
**Target Version:** Conductor v3.0  

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive architectural evolution for the Conductor framework that addresses three critical business objectives:

1. **Open Source Readiness** - Clean separation of framework from proprietary projects
2. **Developer Experience** - Simplified agent discovery and execution model  
3. **Enterprise Scalability** - Containerized execution for production environments

The proposed solution combines **Direct Resolution Architecture** with **Containerized Agent Execution**, eliminating the current `projects/` directory coupling while enabling both local development and production deployment scenarios.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Problems

1. **Open Source Blocker**: Framework repository contains proprietary project references
2. **Coupling Issues**: `projects/develop/` directory creates artificial dependency
3. **Backup Fragmentation**: Agent state scattered across conductor repository
4. **Discovery Complexity**: Agents stored in framework rather than with target projects
5. **Environment Inconsistency**: No guarantee of reproducible execution environments

### Technical Debt Assessment

- **High**: `resolve_agent_paths()` complexity with workspaces.yaml dependencies
- **Medium**: Test infrastructure coupled to specific project structures  
- **Medium**: Documentation references private project names
- **Low**: Administrative overhead of multiple git repositories

---

## Strategic Architecture Vision

### Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Framework code vs. Project-specific agents
2. **Location Transparency**: Agents discoverable regardless of execution context
3. **Environment Reproducibility**: Consistent execution across development and production
4. **Zero Configuration**: Minimal setup for new projects and developers

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Direct Resolution Architecture (4 weeks)

#### 1.1 Agent Path Resolution Refactor

**Objective**: Eliminate `projects/develop/` dependency from conductor core.

```python
def resolve_agent_paths_v3(environment: str, project: str, agent_id: str) -> Tuple[Path, Path]:
    """
    Direct resolution without projects/ directory coupling.
    
    Resolution Order:
    1. Meta-agents in conductor/projects/_common/agents/
    2. Project agents in workspace/project/.conductor/agents/
    """
    
    # Meta-agents: Framework-level agents
    meta_agent_path = Path("projects/_common/agents") / agent_id
    if meta_agent_path.exists():
        return meta_agent_path.resolve(), Path.cwd()
    
    # Project agents: Located within target project
    workspaces = load_workspaces_config()
    project_root = Path(workspaces[environment]) / project
    agent_home = project_root / ".conductor" / "agents" / agent_id
    
    if not agent_home.exists():
        raise AgentNotFoundError(
            f"Agent '{agent_id}' not found.\n"
            f"Searched in:\n"
            f"  - Meta-agents: {meta_agent_path}\n"
            f"  - Project agents: {agent_home}\n"
            f"Ensure agent exists or run onboarding to create project structure."
        )
    
    return agent_home.resolve(), project_root.resolve()
```

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Refactored `resolve_agent_paths_v3()` function

#### 1.3 Test Infrastructure Migration

**Objective**: Move test infrastructure from project dependencies to framework fixtures.

```
tests/
├── fixtures/                   # Framework testing fixtures
│   ├── agents/                # Mock agents for framework tests
│   │   ├── TestKotlinAgent/
│   │   └── MockDocumentAgent/
│   └── projects/              # Mock project structures
│       └── sample-kotlin/
└── integration/               # End-to-end framework tests
```

        self.project = os.environ['CONDUCTOR_PROJECT']
        self.agent_id = os.environ['CONDUCTOR_AGENT_ID']
    
    def execute(self, instruction: str) -> ExecutionResult:
        # Load agent configuration
        agent_config_path = self.workspace / self.project / ".conductor" / "agents" / self.agent_id
        agent_config = self.load_agent_config(agent_config_path)
        
        # Initialize LLM with security constraints
        llm_client = self.create_secure_llm_client(agent_config)
        
        # Execute with sandboxing
        with SecuritySandbox() as sandbox:
            result = llm_client.execute(instruction, context=agent_config)

class HybridExecutor:
    """
    Intelligent executor that chooses execution mode based on context.
    
    Local Execution: Development, debugging, quick iterations
    Container Execution: Production, CI/CD, resource isolation
    """
    
    def determine_execution_mode(self, project: str, agent_id: str, context: ExecutionContext) -> ExecutionMode:
        project_config = load_project_config(project)
        
        # Force container mode for production environments
        if context.environment in ['production', 'staging']:
            return ExecutionMode.CONTAINER
            
        # Use container mode if project specifies it
        if project_config.runtime.type == 'docker':
            return ExecutionMode.CONTAINER
            
        # Default to local for development
        return ExecutionMode.LOCAL
    
    def execute(self, project: str, agent_id: str, instruction: str) -> ExecutionResult:
        mode = self.determine_execution_mode(project, agent_id, self.context)
        
        if mode == ExecutionMode.CONTAINER:
            return self.container_executor.execute(project, agent_id, instruction)
        else:
