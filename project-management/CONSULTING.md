# ü§ù Consulting & Advisory Services

Leverage the expertise behind the Conductor Framework to accelerate your AI-driven development initiatives. As the architect and lead developer of Conductor, I offer specialized consulting and advisory services to help organizations design, implement, and optimize their AI agent ecosystems.

## About Me

I am a Backend Software Engineer with a passion for building technology, driven by the pursuit of innovative and efficient solutions. My journey spans the entire software development lifecycle, from conception and architecture to deployment, maintenance, optimization, and quality assurance.

My technical toolkit is robust and versatile. I develop resilient and scalable microservices using Kotlin, orchestrated with Kubernetes. In parallel, I leverage Python for a variety of applications, from agile automation scripts and data analysis in environments like Jupyter Lab, to the development of lightweight and efficient projects. My database experience covers both the NoSQL (MongoDB) and relational (SQL) universes. The AWS ecosystem is my natural environment for building cloud-native infrastructures, with practical experience in services like SQS for messaging, S3 for storage, and EC2, EKS for flexible computing.

I am a strong advocate for automation (DevOps), with solid experience in implementing CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins and GitActions) to streamline deliveries and ensure continuous integration. I believe quality is non-negotiable, and therefore, I practice Test Driven Development (TDD), ensuring every line of code contributes to robust and reliable software. Mastering the entire flow, from code to deployment, is not just a goal, but a daily practice.

My curiosity and desire for continuous learning led me to set up and maintain a personal bare-metal server. This personal lab is where I explore new technologies, test advanced Docker and Kubernetes configurations, and experiment with MongoDB instances and other emerging tools. It's also where I put into practice my growing interest in AI for coding, seeking ways to utilize artificial intelligence to optimize the development process itself, increase productivity, and automate repetitive tasks.

My career goals are firmly directed towards stimulating challenges in backend development and Artificial Intelligence. Opportunities where I can not only apply my technical expertise and passion for innovation but also collaborate with dynamic teams in creating solutions. I am particularly interested in projects that explore the potential of MCP and LLMs to create disruptive and intelligent automations.
