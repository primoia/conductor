# Roadmap of Future Improvements

This document outlines a roadmap of potential improvements that could be implemented to evolve this project from a robust prototype to a complete, resilient, and scalable production system.

---

### 1. Persistence Layer Enhancement

-   **Real Database:** Replace the JSON file-based `ItemRepository` with an implementation that connects to a real database.
    -   **SQL:** Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy to ensure atomic transactions and strong consistency.
    -   **NoSQL:** Use MongoDB for greater data schema flexibility.
-   **Distributed Cache:** Introduce a caching layer (like Redis) in front of the database to drastically optimize read operations (`GET`), reducing latency for frequently accessed items.

### 2. API Robustness and Security

-   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement an authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2 with JWT) to protect write endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`), ensuring that only authorized users/services can modify data.
-   **Rate Limiting:** Add a request limiter to prevent abuse and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
-   **API Versioning:** Evolve API versioning (e.g., from `/api/v1` to `/api/v2`) to allow significant changes without breaking compatibility with old clients.

### 3. Test Coverage Expansion

-   **Mutation Testing:** Introduce mutation testing (with tools like `mutmut`) to verify the effectiveness of our test suite, ensuring that tests fail if code logic is improperly altered.
-   **Contract Testing:** If this API were consumed by another service, we could implement contract testing (using a tool like Pact) to ensure integrations don't break.
-   **Performance Testing:** Conduct load and stress tests (with tools like Locust or k6) to understand the application's limits under high demand and identify performance bottlenecks.

### 4. Infrastructure and Deploy (CI/CD)

-   **Reverse Proxy with Nginx:** Introduce Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of the application to manage incoming traffic, serve static files, and handle SSL termination (HTTPS), freeing the Python application server from this responsibility.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create an automated pipeline (e.g., with GitHub Actions) that, on each push to the main branch, executes linting, tests, and if they pass, builds and publishes the Docker image to a registry (like Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
-   **Container Orchestration:** For a real production environment, migrate from Docker Compose to a more robust orchestrator like Kubernetes, allowing auto-scaling, rolling updates, and high availability.

### 5. Advanced Observability

-   **Metrics:** Implement metrics export (using `Prometheus-FastAPI-Instrumentator`) for real-time monitoring of application health (latency, error rate, requests per second) in dashboards (with Grafana).
-   **Distributed Tracing:** If the system evolved into a microservices architecture, integrate OpenTelemetry to allow tracing requests across different services, facilitating the debugging of complex problems.
