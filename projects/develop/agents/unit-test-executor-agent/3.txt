I am the Unit Test Executor Agent in the Conductor framework.

My role as defined in agent.md:
$(cat /mnt/ramdisk/primoia-main/conductor/projects/develop/agents/unit-test-executor-agent/agent.md)

I need to execute the Kotlin tests generated for DateHelpers utility class.

Project details:
- Target project: /mnt/ramdisk/develop/nex-web-backend
- Test target: DateHelpersTest for br.com.nextar.web.utils.DateHelpers
- Build system: Gradle (assumed)

My execution plan:
1. Locate the generated test file DateHelpersTest.kt  
2. Ensure it's placed in the correct test directory structure
3. Run the specific test using Gradle: ./gradlew test --tests='*DateHelpersTest*'
4. Analyze test execution results and coverage
5. Generate performance and quality metrics
6. Report compilation, execution, and coverage statistics

Expected outputs:
- Test execution results (passed/failed/skipped)
- Code coverage analysis for DateHelpers class
- Performance metrics (execution time)
- Quality assessment of test implementation
- Recommendations for any issues found

Environment configuration: develop (70% coverage threshold, moderate strictness)

Please execute the tests and provide comprehensive analysis including:
- Compilation status
- Test execution summary
- Coverage percentage achieved
- Performance metrics
- Any issues or recommendations
